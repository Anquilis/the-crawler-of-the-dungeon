# Changelog
This file will keep track of notable changes.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)

## Known Bugs
- The program will crash if the player inputs a letter, a space, or any kind of special character (kept for debgugging)
- When at the entrance of the boss room (3,3), you can go out of bounds


## [0.1] - 2020-6-12
### Added
- Version control!
- This new, more organized changelog file! (now in markdown)
- Concpets file to plan out different features
- A code directory in the readme file
- A 'print_dropped_items' check if the player defeats a monster at the gate of the boss room and drops an item
### Changed
- Placed 'dungeon = generate_dungeon()' line in game loop so that all discovered tiles from last dungeon reverts back to an undiscovered tile, which is blank
- Tweaked the stat_progression function where the player is restored to full HP once they level up
- The shop will now refresh once the player executes an action and cleans up the console
- Boss_position is now just a tuple value, not a tuple within a list (see below)
