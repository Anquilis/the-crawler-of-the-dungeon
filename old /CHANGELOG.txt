# move along, everything is rewritten more nicely in CHANGELOG.md

6/9/20

  More story elements
  More dungeons and monsters
  More items 
    Better swords that increase critical hits
    More potions?
  Ability to defend against attacks
  Dream features:
  More random dungeon layouts
    Floors
  A blacksmith where you can craft your own weapons from items found in a dungeon AND/OR

  A place where you can train your skills:
  Strength: determines chance of critical hit, along with the damage
  Attack Technique: determines chance of stronger attack [there is current a weak,base, and strong attack]
  attack = [baseAtk-1,baseAtk,baseAtk+1]
  Defense Technique: determines defense level
  Once you clear the first dungeon the blacksmith can help you learn how to defend

  layout/blacksmith lines can be 

  "Hey NAME, I see that you have started to fight monsters for the Knights of Arion, eh? I used to be a blacksmith for them a long time ago."

  "I could teach you a few tricks and techniques, to better equip you for battle. For a start, let me teach you the basic techniques of defending. It will be your best weapon against death."

  "I've seen too many young squires swinging their swords like it is some kind of axe. That is why we train them through proper technique, until they become good enough serve the kingdom of Arion ."

  "I don't know why they would send someone like you out to fight monsters for them without proper training. But, I guess it was fate for me to teach you."

  What would you like to do? [1] UPGRADE [2] LEAVE BLACKSMITH

  This gives me ideas on his background and story
    he was once a blacksmith for the knights of Arion
    he wants you to become the strongest, but is that what you desire to do? to become a monster slayer?
    can monsters become our friend instead of our foe?
    is there more to the fighting between the monsters and the humans?
    i kind of want to focus on individuality

  Added 'read' function to handle story elements of game
  Continued to add game lines to narrator_lines
  Added treasure chests and traps!
    Made sure events don't overlap
  key chance drop increased from 66% to 75%
  BUGS:
    Dungeon rooms don't align correctly (due to how undiscovered rooms have a specific amount of spaces that might not match the rooms length)
    ex: undiscovered room     "     " 5 spaces
        discovered room       "=[ - ]=" is longer than undiscovered room, so there is a slight shift
    [FIXED]
