## THE BLACKSMITH

 A blacksmith where you can craft your own weapons from items found in a dungeon AND/OR

A place where you can train your skills:
  - Strength: determines chance of critical hit, along with the damage
  - Attack Technique: determines chance of stronger attack 
  - Defense Technique: determines defense level

Once you clear the first dungeon the blacksmith can help you learn how to defend

  "Hey PLAYER_NAME, I see that you have started to fight monsters for the Knights of Arion, eh? I used to be a blacksmith for them a long time ago."

  "I could teach you a few tricks and techniques, to better equip you for battle. For a start, let me teach you the basic techniques of defending. It will be your best weapon against death."

  "I've seen too many young squires swinging their swords like it is some kind of axe. That is why we train them through proper technique, until they become good enough serve the Kingdom of Arion ."

  "I don't know why they would send someone like you out to fight monsters for them without proper training."
